                    "We deploy industrial edge gateways equipped with protocol converters. This allows us to safely ingest older serial or PLC protocols (like Modbus or Profinet) and securely package them into MQTT or OPC UA data streams for cloud parsing."

                    "We strictly align with the ISA/IEC 62443 standard. We leverage network micro-segmentation, zero-trust industrial switches, and continuous behavior monitoring to ensure that an IT breach cannot cross over and compromise physical production environments."

                answer:
                    "Absolutely. True digitalization requires syncing shop-floor reality with enterprise finance. We specialize in building reliable, bidirectional APIs between production floor MES systems and core ERP platforms like SAP or Microsoft Dynamics."

            {
                question: "What is the typical timeline for an initial smart manufacturing pilot?",
                answer:
                    "A targeted Proof of Value (PoV) focusing on an individual high-value assembly line or critical machine asset typically takes 6 to 8 weeks from hardware sensor installation to live dashboard data visualization."
