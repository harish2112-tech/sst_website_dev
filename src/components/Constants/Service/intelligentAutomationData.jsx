        description: "Intelligent Automation (IA) combines Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to automate complex, end-to-end business operations. By integrating cognitive technologies with execution, SST enables systems to not only perform repetitive tasks but also analyze, learn, and make decisions over time.",

        whyItMatters: "Traditional automation only handles rule-based tasks. Intelligent Automation adapts to changing situations, processes unstructured data (like invoices or contracts), and continuously refines its efficiency, creating a hyper-agile digital workforce.",
        whySST: "At SST, we design, deploy, and scale tailor-made automation strategies. We don't just supply tools; we co-create long-term automation roadmaps aligned directly to your commercial KPIs and operational needs.",

            {
                question: "How is Intelligent Automation different from standard RPA?",
                answer: "Standard RPA executes simple, predefined, rule-based tasks (e.g., copy-pasting data). Intelligent Automation integrates AI and Machine Learning, allowing the system to handle unstructured data, detect patterns, learn from exceptions, and execute intelligent decision-making."
            },
            {
                question: "How long does it take to deploy an automation project?",
                answer: "A standard pilot program or proof-of-concept (POC) can take 4 to 8 weeks. Larger enterprise-wide integrations with cognitive decision points usually range from 3 to 6 months depending on process complexity."
            },
            {
                question: "Will IA replace our existing legacy software?",
                answer: "No. One of the main advantages of Intelligent Automation and RPA is that they interact with your existing legacy systems through user interfaces or APIs, meaning you do not need to replace or rewrite your core legacy systems."
            },
            {
                question: "How do you ensure security and regulatory compliance?",
